# Weather App

## Overview

This GitHub project is a JavaFX-based weather application that allows users to view current weather conditions, search for weather data of specific cities, and analyze statistical information. The project is divided into three main tabs: Overview, Search, and Stats.

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a snapshot of the current weather for a selected city. Users can see details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and UV index. The tab also includes navigation buttons to view previous and next days. Users can save the weather data for a city, and there is an option to generate a report (PDF) with statistical information.

### Search Tab

In the Search tab, users can enter the name of a city to view its weather data. The application supports features like saving, deleting, and editing weather data for a specific city. A list of previously searched cities is displayed, and users can select a city to view its detailed information, including location on a map.

### Stats Tab

The Stats tab provides statistical weather data, offering insights into the most popular searches for city weather data. Users can view tables of cities and their corresponding weather data, including information such as date, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and UV index. The data is presented in a user-friendly table format.
